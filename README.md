# APP1 - Part B

This repository contains (1) the statement and (2) the Jupyter Notebook that serves as interactive contents.

The statement should be modified and compiled via Overleaf (access can be granted upon request).

Every time changes occur, the Binder's image must be built again (this takes time).
To access the Binder, click on the second logo above.

A **faster** solution is to use JupyterLite, which runs on your browser too.
To access it, click on the first logo above.

## JupyterLite or Binder

Both options are fine, but the first one is more likely to run faster,
because it uses a pre-built image and all the computations occur on your
computer. Binder has the only benefit of supporting the `hide_code` extension,
which makes the overall Notebook look a bit cleaner.
